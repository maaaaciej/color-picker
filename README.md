# Color Guessing Game

A color guessing game made in vanilla JS. A function creates six div-elements with random background colors, and one of these divs  gets assigned the correct color value. The value of the correct color gets displayed at the top of the website, and the user has to click the correct colored square. If a wrong square gets clicked, the background gets changed to the background color of the whole page, making it 'dissapeer'. Upon clicking the correct one, all of the divs change their color to the correct one. 

I use this website often when working with projects, to get some inspiration on new colors, as well as getting some training in guessing RGB values.
